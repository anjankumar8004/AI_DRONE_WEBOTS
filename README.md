# AI_DRONE_WEBOTS
   **An AI-driven drone navigation and obstacle avoidance using Webots leverage neural networks for real-time environmental analysis, enabling autonomous flight decision-making and obstacle evasion within simulated environments. - Webots, Python, Neural networks**

   *There are two webots controllers under controller folder that are resposible for

a)data collection[for collecting data],  
b)AI Drone main [which Runs the drone using trained model]


1.AI_Drone_DataCol.py : will help with collecting the image data.
2.AI_Drone_DataPrep.ipynb :  will help with data preparation.
3.AI_Drone_modelbuilding.ipynb : will help with building the model.
4.AIDrone_Main.py : Will help with run the drone automatically using the model built.


NOTE 1: [while using in webots] - > Choose First controller while collecting the data, And second controller after building and saved the model.
NoTE 2: Train data been included in Train data folder, that gathered duing the data collection process.
