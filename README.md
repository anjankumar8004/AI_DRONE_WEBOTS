# AI_DRONE_WEBOTS
   An AI-driven drone navigation and obstacle avoidance using Webots leverage neural networks for real-time environmental analysis, enabling autonomous flight decision-making and obstacle evasion within simulated environments. - Webots, Python, Neural networks

   There are two controllers under controller folder that are resposible for
a)data collection[for collecting data],  
b)AI Drone main [which Runs the drone using trained model]
